## DERBi PIE

::: fragment
-   Etymological database, with multiple references.
    -   Currently:
        -   all of LIV parsed (thanks Thomas Olander!)
        -   Currently parsing (Tim Dempsey):
            -   NIL (this December)
            -   half of Pokorny (next July), inshallah
    -   Working towards: everything (?!?)
-   How to differentiate: weight etymologies according to prominence and citation
-   Have applied for NEH funding, hopefully this will put us closer to the goal of releasing to public.

## DERBi PIE: Query Searches <!--# Insert DERBi PIE wheel header -->

::: fragment
-   Search Functions Created
    -   Integrated Texts - identify roots, stems, and words in texts
    -   Phonological Search - identify roots, stems, and words by phonological shape (regex)
    -   Morphological Search - identify roots, stems, and words by morphological property (POS, class, gender, etc.)
-   Quickly realized that to identify semantic categories and relationships -- especially ones that make sense across languages -- is ***not*** an easy task

This is the problem: how on earth to do this? <!--# Center (vert & horiz), increase size/improve style, etc. -->

# Tactic #1: WordNet

## WordNet: What is it?

-   A large, organized lexical database of English words
-   Groups words into "synsets" (sets of synonyms) based on meanings

## WordNet: What is it?

-   Provides relationships between words, such as:
    -   **Synonyms** (similar meanings, e.g. "dog", "pooch")
    -   **Antonyms** (opposite meanings, e.g. "bad", "good")
    -   **Hypernyms** (general terms, e.g., "animal" for "dog")
    -   **Hyponyms** (specific terms, e.g., "dog" for "animal")

## WordNet: Building One for PIE?

-   Working with a team of UK CS undergraduates, we mapped a list of PIE roots and words (primarily from Pokorny) onto the English WordNet structure
-   1500 roots successfully mapped
-   Numerous difficulties with entries that do not map neatly:
    -   *\*aghlu- (IEW*, p. 8) 'dark cloud; rainy weather': new hyponym (of both 'cloud' and 'weather') needed
    -   *\*ab- (IEW*, p. 1) 'water, river': new hypernym needed? or two mappings?
-   The general idea of English \|\> PIE is flawed, because PIE ≠ English!

## WordNet: Broader Problems

-   **Limited Scope of Meanings**: Doesn’t capture all nuances of word usage
-   **Lack of Context**: Doesn’t account for how context alters word meaning
-   **Not All Languages Have Wordet**: WordNets in some languages are better developed than in others
-   **MUST BE DONE MANUALLY**
